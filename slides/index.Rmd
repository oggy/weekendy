## What's an interesting language to study?

<br />

Perhaps:

* One which people are using on GitHub.
* One which people are playing with in their spare time (on the weekend).
* One with a decently active community -- not too fringe.

<br />

**This calls for an app!**

## Method

* Take 1 month of recent events.
* Aggregate the number of users pushing to repos of each language.
* Filter out very fringe languages (hard to extrapolate).

```{r}
data <- read.table('../counts.txt', sep=',', comment.char='', header=TRUE)
head(data[data$week == 1 & data$total_users >= 200,])
```

## Scoring

* Raw counts aren't interesting. Of course Javascript is at the top!
* Normalize weekend counts by full-week counts to get a "weekendiness" score.

```{r}
slice <- data[data$week == 1 & data$total_users >= 200,]
slice$score <- slice$weekend_users / slice$total_users
head(slice[order(-slice$score),])
```

* All these languages look pretty interesting!

## Am I normal?

And look, R is #1 in 2 of the 4 weeks of June.

So creating data presentations in R might be a totally normal thing to do on the
weekend. **Yes!**
